what happens if you are chatting or have a date with someone and they block you

update loading buttons the same way i do for block user on view profile page

add security checks for dateService, make sure user updating date has access to it.
look through all controller/service methods, make sure the actions being done make sense and are allowed.

finish all emails related to dates, accepted, declined, changed, etc, reminders

handle user's timezone when displaying dates

showUploadErr

adjust maxLenghths for fields when proposing a date, (35 is too short)

when you block someone, delete all the messages and dates between you two

add validations (length, maybe other things) to user displayname (first name)
