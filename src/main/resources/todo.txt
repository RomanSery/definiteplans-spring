you know what would be cool... and adds safety ..
users cannot send messages or cannot set plans unless they have uploaded a profile picture



seeing actual feedback is kinda exciting
like a comment, first impression
something along those lines



service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /images/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read;
      allow write: if metadataUserId() == userId
      	&& request.resource.size <= 5 * 1024 * 1024
        && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
    }

  }

  function metadataUserId() { return request.resource.metadata.userId; }
}
