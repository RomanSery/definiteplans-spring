when logging and user is not active, it shows error message but also need to show link to resent email with confirmation link

store last_login_date, use for sorting in browse results, show when user was last online

finish blocked users in profile settings

domisc?action=findzip

login with fb & google

reset filters button in browse page

browse page paging


delete my account

finish implementing user.isProfileCompleted


clarify settings in edit profile - visible to ages, also means you wont be able to see them!

update loading buttons the same way i do for block user on view profile page
