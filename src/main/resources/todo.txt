add security checks for dateService, make sure user updating date has access to it.
look through all controller/service methods, make sure the actions being done make sense and are allowed.

org.springframework.security.authentication.BadCredentialsException: Bad credentials
org.springframework.security.authentication.InternalAuthenticationServiceException: password cannot be null - notify if fb/google user trying to login with pwd

showUploadErr

show notification somewhere when you have an unread chat message, maybe in header and in calendar view

if youve already registered with an email, but try to login with fb/google it should not allow it like it is right now.  it should say
you've already registered with that email, pleaes login with google or fb, depending on which one you already registered with.
